This plugin provides hooks into JRuby and Compass to dynamically compile SCSS/SASS during run-app and compile during WAR creation.
Currently, the plugin requires that jruby be installed and on the path of the user's system, although running exclusively from
JAR dependencies is the end-goal.

Compass:

SCSS/SASS:

To build:
